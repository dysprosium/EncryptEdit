# EncryptEdit
##### Automatically encrypting text editor
###### Created by Christopher Liu

EncryptEdit allows seamless encrypted text-editing, with encryption on each save and decryption upon loading any file. Use it for writing sensitive data without the hassle of a separate encryption process, for writing insensitive data without the hassle of a separate, for making insensitive data appear to be sensitive, for instilling respect and fear among your peers, for instilling empathy among your peers for your sensitive data, or just to look cool. EncryptEdit does it all!

EncryptEdit, programmed in Java, uses positional data included within the output text and derived from the encryption key and a pseudorandom seed to further scramble the encrypted data and make the uninformed scratch their heads at the seemingly random arrangement of the outputted Unicode characters. Said output Unicode characters are conveniently often obscure and tend to be taxing on the graphics card to render, adding another layer on semi-intentional security by causing great amounts of lag for those foolish enough to open an EncryptEdit document without proper decryption. Moreover, output text is unique and different on each encryption, though still yielding the same decrypted data, further confounding attempted comprehension. Welcome to the future.
